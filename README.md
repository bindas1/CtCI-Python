# Python Solutions to *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition*

These are **Python** solutions for the book [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](https://www.careercup.com/book) by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*.

For each of the questions from the book, I implement my own solution. However, note that this repository with initial solutions is a clone of this [repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python).
